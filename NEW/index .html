<p>8th Grader now but a future graphic designer.<br> My passion for arts, drawing, sculpture and painting from a very young age has driven my interest towards graphic designing.<br> I am currently learning different techniques of graphic designing on different software. </p>

 <p>The most valuable lesson I have learned from school has been the importance of drawing before moving into different artforms.<br> Even though I know I want to be a graphic designer, I have enjoy getting back to basics with sketching. <br>
This year I will try to mastered Canva and HTML.<br> I will continue to build skills in UI/UX. Next year, I hope to join a course that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills. <br> </p>
